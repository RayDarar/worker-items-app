## Development process üë∑

### Making plan

First of all of course, you start from creating a plan, that one was easy enough. I started from skimming the requirements from what the application structure was understandable enough to make predictions. I chose Postgres (because it was the first in the list of dbs) and started scratching the whole system.

### The architecture

Simple Client-Server architecture build under REST abstraction. Client make calls to the REST service which generates query to the Relational DB.

### Designing entities

- Workers are described by their full name
- Workers could have 0 or more items
- Items are described by name and price

### Decompose the web app

Main page consists of the table which displays `workers_stats` view. The app will fetch the amount of workers in the system, that number will be used to determine the number of pages.

Table itself will be used later, so it makes sense to create generic table view which consists of generic table rows. Table rows could be used for emitting events for mouse clicks and performing custom logic.

Editing or creating new worker, form looks the same, so single component will be used for both, however for different actions we could create two different routes. Those routes will have different metadata to determine logic inside.

Worker form has items table.

Overall, simple CRUD operations and a little bit of routing here, vuex not required.

### Plan and document the API

As REST's main principle to abstract things out, I'll do classical HTTP to CRUD mapping:

- `POST` for **C**reate
- `GET` for **R**ead
- `PUT` for **U**pdate
- `Delete` for **D**elete

API documentation could be found [here](api.md).
